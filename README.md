# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project performs customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** from `scikit-learn`. The dataset includes basic customer information like annual income and spending scores.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

A small synthetic dataset is used with the following columns:
- `Customer_ID`: Unique ID of the customer
- `Annual_income`: Customer's yearly income
- `Spending_Score`: Score reflecting spending behavior

## ðŸ“ˆ K-Means Clustering

The K-Means algorithm clusters customers into predefined groups based on their spending and income patterns.


## ðŸ“Ž Visualizations

Two plots are generated:
1. **Initial Distribution**: A scatterplot showing the raw distribution of customers.
2. **K-Means Clusters**: A scatterplot showing clustered groups, with centroids marked.
